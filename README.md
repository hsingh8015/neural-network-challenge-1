# Student Loan Risk with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to use a neural network to predict whether students will successfully repay their loans. Neural networks are computer models that learn from data, similar to how the human brain works. Weâ€™ll use TensorFlow and Keras, which are tools in Python, to build and train this model.

## Functionality

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - **Load Data**: Import data from a CSV file and check its layout.
    - **Identify Features and Target**: Define the input data (features) and what we want to predict (target).
    - **Split Data**: Separate the data into training and testing sets.
    - **Scale Data**: Normalize the features for better model performance.
 
2. **Model Creation**:
    - **Build Model**: Create a Sequential model.
    - **Add Layers**: Include input, hidden, and output layers, using different activation functions.
    - **Compile Model**: Prepare the model with specific loss functions and optimizers.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - **Train Model**: Train the model using the training data over 50 epochs.
    - **Evaluate Model**: Test the model's performance with the test data and check accuracy.

4. **Model Usage**:
    - **Save Model**: Store the trained model in a file.
    - **Load Model**: Retrieve the model for future predictions.
    - **Make Predictions**: Use the model to predict loan repayment success on the test data.
    - **Classification Report**: Create a report showing how well the model performed.

## Summary
In short, this project uses neural networks to predict if students will repay their loans. It involves preparing data, building and training the model, and evaluating its performance.

**Real-World Applications**:
1. **Personalized Financial Advice:**: Financial advisors can use the model to provide tailored loan repayment strategies for students based on their individual financial situations, helping them manage their debt more effectively.
2. **Targeted Outreach Programs**: Educational institutions can identify at-risk student populations using the model's insights, allowing them to implement support programs, such as financial literacy workshops or counseling services, to improve student outcomes and repayment rates.

The project also features a recommendation system that collects essential student data to recommend suitable loans while prioritizing privacy and fairness. This approach helps students identify the best financial aid options tailored to their needs.
